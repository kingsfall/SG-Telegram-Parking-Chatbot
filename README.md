# SG Parking ChatBot
A chatbot to identify nearest available parking spaces & cost in Singapore developed on telegram using nodered and python. Please feel free to use the Telegram chatbot. Link: tg://resolve?domain=Sg_parkingbot

Please feel free to hit me up if you're keen on collaborating or have some ideas for improvements.

## Context
Parking in Singapore is expensive. For folks who don't mind walking a bit more and parking at HDB or URA specified parking spots instead of paying a SIGNIFICANT higher price for private parking will see a TON of savings.

Compare parking cost VS distance from destination to make the most informed decision.
